# Constellation

Welcome to Constellation, we are an innovative project targeting writers and
their teams that helps building narrative universes.

Wanted to start writing your own universe, but it always seemed like something
too big to handle properly? Narrative incoherences, forgetting events and
characters, no project management solution in traditional writing software...

Constellation aims to change that. By giving you the tools you need to write a
coherent universe and manage it as a first class citizen. Creating maps,
character sheets, relationships, and quality text editing incorporating all
our features.
