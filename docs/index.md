# Constellation

Welcome to Constellation, an innovative platform for writers and their teams 
to build and manage narrative universes collaboratively.

## What is Constellation?

Wanted to start writing your own universe, but it always seemed like something
too big to handle properly? Narrative inconsistencies, forgetting events and
characters, no project management solutions in traditional writing software...

Constellation aims to change that by giving you the tools you need to write a
coherent universe and manage it as a first-class citizen. Create maps,
character sheets, and relationships, all with quality text editing that
incorporates our features seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Real-time collaborative text editing** with conflict-free synchronization
- **File management** with granular **access control**
- Create **element sheets** to enrich your universe (characters, locations, events)
- Add **relationships** and visualize them in our interactive graph view
- Upload and **annotate maps** with your universe elements
- **Live notifications** for team updates
- **No AI** - we don't use LLMs and are committed to protecting your creativity
- **Self-hostable** for complete data ownership and infrastructure control
